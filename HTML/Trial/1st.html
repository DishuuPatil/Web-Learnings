            <h2> Chicken Poem</h2>
            <p>
                A chicken whose name was Chantecler <br>
                Clucked in iambic pentameter <br>
                It sat on a shelf, reading Song of Myself <br>
                And laid eggs with a perfect diameter. <br>

        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl,
            is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, originally from
            Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male
            bird,
            and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird
            is
            called
            a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>

            <p>An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States) and an adult female is called a hen.
            </p>
            <p> <b>"Chicken"</b> was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.
                But thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in
                general,
                especially in American English. "Chicken" as a specie,
                and in older sources was typically referred as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>

            <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>

            <p>Chickens are omnivores.<sup><a href="somewhat.com">[25]</a></sup> In the wild, they often scratch at the
                soil
                to
                search for seeds, insects and even
                animals as large as lizards, small snakes,<sup>[26]</sup> or young mice.<sup>[27]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed. The world's oldest known
                chicken
                was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World
                Records.<sup>[29]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
                shiny,
                pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder
                colours
                than those of females of the same breed.

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks.
            They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
            Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order",
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations.
            Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until
            a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds,
            to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury. When a rooster finds food,
            he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as
            picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call
            their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>

        <h4>Crowing</h4>
        <p>Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age.
            Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development)
            is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.</p>
