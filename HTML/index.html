    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"Cuttles" redirects here. For the card game, see Cuttle.</p>
    <p><b>Cuttlefish</b> or <b>cuttles</b> are marine <a href="nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order <b>Sepiida</b>. They
        belong to the class
        Cephalopoda, which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.</p>
    <p>Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.</p>
    <p>Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is
        about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.
        Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.</p>

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late
        Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
        Octopodiformes, remains unclear.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <p>The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft). They have an
        unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the
        Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the
        time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep
        for these warm-water species to cross. The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are
        found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m
        (600 ft).</p>

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil
        is a smoothly curving W-shape.</p>

    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
        haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
        The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills
        (one heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more
        rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin.
        Unlike most other mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.</p>

    <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite. The
        pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the
        chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle. Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and
        pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that
        distinguish them from their squid relatives.</p>
